# Hi, I’m Byron! 👋🏾

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeherk/codeherk/main/github-header.png" alt="banner that says - Byron Jenkins. Software engineer and content creator.">

I'm a software engineer and content creator. My sole purpose is to continously learn 
and share my wealth of knowledge. I use social media platforms to deliver educational 
content about Tech with the hopes of inspiring others to code, especially minorities!


## I'm currently working on:

- Learning more about Go and Event Driven Architecture
- Using AWS MORE ☁
- Looking into attending Tech Conferences
